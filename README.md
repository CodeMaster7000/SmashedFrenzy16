### About Me

My name is SmashedFrenzy16. I joined GitHub in 2020, and started my path to creating all sorts of projects that I could make for the rest of the world. I mostly work in Python and HTML, building all sorts of different repositories that meet people's different needs. I also collaborate with other developers. CodeMaster7000 and I have been collaborating to further improve the way you use your computers. Today, after quite a bit of time on open-source coding, I have started to update my GitHub page more regularly. All of my projects are here to help you.
